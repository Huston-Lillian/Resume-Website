                <p>My journey into coding began when I discovered how a simple loop could turn a jumble of numbers into something useful. That spark led me to intern as a software tester at Trideum Corporation and co-develop Consolidev with classmates. I love numbers and analytics, and I’m fascinated by spotting patterns and turning data into insights. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a B.S. in Computer Science from Texas A&M–Central Texas and earned a microcredential in Business Analytics & Intelligence. When I’m not architecting software solutions, hunting down stubborn bugs, or building React applications, you’ll find me solving puzzles (including 3D puzzles), reading non-fiction, or out on a hike.</p>
